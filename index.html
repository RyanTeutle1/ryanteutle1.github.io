    <h1>Claim</h1>
    <p> Inside the mystery black box is a series of tubing that loops around the box and allows water in and out.
    
    <h1>Evidence</h1>
    <p> When we ran trials on the mystery black box the information that we had was incredibly vague, all we saw on the outside was a funnel at the top of the box and a spout made of tubing at the bottom of it with a little hole cut out. Our approach was, we first put in 500mL of water in the funnel of the black box and this number stayed consistent throughout our trials. Our first trial we put 500 mL of water and only received 350mL back, this is when we knew there was some elaborate mechanism working from within the box that was holding and capturing the remaining 150mL of water. We ran another test with the same 500mL and this time got back a little more than what was put in the funnel. This is how we confirmed that there was something storing all the water that was kept during our last trial. We set out to create a model that would allow us to get a more in depth view of what could have been inside of the black box. Our model consisted of a cardboard box and tubing that created 2 different pathways that ended up leading into the output of the box. The second pathway is where the majority of the water would be sent because the second pathway had the ability to stall the water to capture it and once a certain amount of water allowed the stored water to be released. This caused the final output of water to vary and be less or more or even no water output.  </p>

      <h1>Reasoning</h1>
    <h3>Reasoning Part 1</h3>
    <p> A model is a watered down version of the actual mystery black box that allows us to see inside of what could be inside the box.<p>

    <h3>Reasoning Part 2</h3> 
    <p> My evidence supports my claim because when we tested our model, our results came back fairly similar to those of the black box.<p>
    <h3>Reasoning Part 3</h3>
    <p> The data would have been different if there was a different form in which the water was dispensed, leading to different amounts of water being dispensed. Such as, if there were no forms of tubing and the water was directed in a straight line.<p>

       <h3>Qualitative / Quantitative Keen Details:</h3>
    <p> We noticed that the higher amount of water that we inserted then led to less water that came out, but if we added less water then more came out, and that is due to the stored water that is in the box, after each trial the stored water in the tubing and it took more water, when inserted, to fully leave the tubing. We had an even point where we inserted 300 mL of water and got exactly back 300 mL.<p>
